The start of the journey
Hi there!

Patrick here. This is the beginning of a new career/research path for me. After three degrees in civil engineering, I have decided to start picking up new skills I need to develop technology solutions to construction problems, specifically around a shared economy and BIM.

I unsure about a how this journey will pan out, but I am not in doubt. I look forward to rewarding engagements and experiences here. Lets go!
